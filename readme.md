# Announcement

*orange pi 5 image has a new pipeline using an SRT server so you can use h265 for better quality instead of h264 to the old local rtmp server*
`h265_srt_localhost_publish_live`

A lot more features have been added. some of them are described on [Orange Pi 5 Setup](orangepi.md)

## moowss-server is in the making. looking good, secure authentication and remote control working, just some final work
